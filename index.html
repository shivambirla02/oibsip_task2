             <p class="personalInfo">Mahendra Singh Dhoni was born on July 7, 1981 at Ranchi, Jharkhand located in the east corner of India. He studied at
             DAV Jawahar Vidya Mandir where he was keenly interested in football and badminton. He was the goalkeeper of his football
             team and was able to play for the district and state level. But on the insistence of his football coach, he tried out to
             play cricket. He was able to perform wicket keeping especially well which allowed him entry into a local cricket club
             called the Commando cricket club where he played from 1995-1998. In the 1997/98 season, his superb performances in the
             Vinoo Mankad Under-16 Championship attracted the selector’s eye.</p>
